You can experiment with Lean by running an
[online](https://leanprover.github.io/live/) Javascript version in
your browser (see also the [community version](https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-web-editor/)).
If you have installed Lean locally, you can use it
interactively with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). See the
[Using Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/reference/using_lean.html)
chapter of the reference manual for details.

Lean is a work in progress. You are welcome to experiment with it, but please
recognize that the system is still changing, and if you are looking
for stability, it may not be the system for you. Similarly, the project
cannot accommodate feature requests at this stage. If you are trying to decide
whether to invest time in learning to use Lean right now, this
[FAQ](https://github.com/leanprover/lean/blob/master/doc/faq.md) may be helpful.

The [learning resources page](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html) 
of the community website lists many tutorials and documentation sources.

## Chat Room

A public chat room dedicated to Lean is open on [Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/).

## Forum

You are welcome to join the [Lean user forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/lean-user) on Google Groups.
